## <a name = "pd" style="color: black;">Project Description</a>
Weeble is a web application that allows users to match and connect with individuals who share
similar interests and/or hobbies. This application will allow the user to create a profile in which
they can express their preferences, hobbies, and interests. It will then take these parameters into
consideration and find compatible matches that fit the userâ€™s criteria. In comparison to other
dating websites in the market, the algorithm designed for this application will have a strong focus
on prioritizing the hobbies and interests of the user. This software is intended to help facilitate
individuals who are seeking intimate as well as platonic relationships.
