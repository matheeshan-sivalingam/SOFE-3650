## Project Description 

Weeble is a web application that allows users to match and connect with individuals who share
similar interests and/or hobbies. This application will allow the user to create a profile in which
they can express their preferences, hobbies, and interests. It will then take these parameters into
consideration and find compatible matches that fit the user’s criteria. In comparison to other
dating websites in the market, the algorithm designed for this application will have a strong focus
on prioritizing the hobbies and interests of the user. This software is intended to help facilitate
individuals who are seeking intimate as well as platonic relationships. 

## Functional/Non-Functional Requirements 
### Functional Requirements

2. The website should be able to run on all modern browsers (Edge, Google Chrome, Safari, etc)  
3. The database must be able to store atleast 10000 user profiles 
4. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use 
5. All the user's information must be stored securely into the database.
